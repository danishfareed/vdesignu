## Buying Revenue, Not Just Traffic

Paid media is the fastest way to scale, but it's also the easiest place to waste money. **vdesignu** approaches PPC with an engineering mindset. We don't just "set it and forget it"; we constantly optimize your campaigns based on real-world data.

We do not just look at "Impressions" or "CTR." We look at **Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)** and **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**. If the math doesn't work, the campaign doesn't run.

<Callout type="warning" title="The Automation Trap">
Google and Meta want you to use "fully automated" campaigns (like Performance Max) because it spends *your* budget on *their* inventory. We use automation strategically, but keep tight manual controls on negative keywords and placements.

## Chapter 1: The Audience Architecture

Targeting is everything. Showing the right ad to the wrong person is waste.

### 1. Intent vs. Interest
*   **Google Search (Intent)**: Targeting people actively searching for "Buy CRM Software." High cost, high conversion.
*   **LinkedIn/Meta (Interest)**: Targeting people who match a profile (e.g., "CTOs in Dubai"). Lower cost, higher volume, requires nurturing.

### 2. First-Party Data Integration
We upload your existing customer lists to create "Lookalike Audiences" (LALs). These are new people who statistically resemble your best existing customers.

---

## Chapter 2: Creative Engineering

In a feed-based world, the creative *is* the targeting. Algorithms show your ad to people who engage with it.

### 1. The "Scroll Stopper"
We design visuals explicitly to break the pattern of the news feed. High contrast, bold typography, and human faces.

### 2. A/B Testing Matrix
We don't guess; we test.
*   **Headline A vs. Headline B**
*   **Video vs. Static Image**
*   **Long Copy vs. Short Copy**
We kill the losers and double down on the winners every 72 hours.

---

## Chapter 3: The Landing Page Equation

Sending paid traffic to your homepage is setting money on fire. We build dedicated Landing Pages (LPs) for every campaign.

### 1. Message Match
If the ad says "Download Whitepaper," the LP header must say "Download Whitepaper." Disconnects cause bounce rates to spike.

### 2. Zero-Distraction Design
We remove the navigation menu. The user has only two choices: Convert or Leave. This typically doubles conversion rates.

<Callout type="tip" title="Speed Matters">
A 1-second delay in mobile load time can impact conversions by up to 20%. Our LPs load instantly.
</Callout>

## Chapter 4: Conversion Tracking & Attribution

You cannot optimize what you cannot measure.

### 1. Server-Side Tracking (CAPI)
With iOS14 and cookie blocking, browser pixels are losing data. We implement Conversions API (CAPI) to send data directly from the server to Facebook/Google, restoring up to 20% of lost signal.

### 2. Offline Conversion Import
For B2B, the sale happens offline (on a call). We upload "Deal Won" data from your CRM back into Google Ads, training the algorithm to optimize for *revenue*, not just leads.

---

## Chapter 5: B2B Strategies (LinkedIn & Account-Based Marketing)

B2B buying committees are complex. You need to influence multiple stakeholders.

### 1. Account-Based Marketing (ABM)
We upload a list of your "Dream 100" target companies. We show ads *only* to employees of those specific companies.

### 2. Thought Leadership Ads
 promoting value (Whitepapers, Webinars) rather than just "Book a Demo." This builds trust before the ask.

---

## Chapter 6: B2C Strategies (Google Shopping & Meta)

For e-commerce, volume and velocity are key.

### 1. Feed Optimization
Ensuring your product titles and descriptions in Google Merchant Center are keyword-rich. "Blue Shoes" < "Nike Air Max Running Shoes Men's Blue Size 10."

### 2. Dynamic Retargeting
Showing users effective ads featuring the *exact* product they viewed but didn't buy.

---

## Chapter 7: The Optimization Loop

We work in weekly sprints.

*   **Monday**: Bid adjustments based on weekend performance.
*   **Wednesday**: Creative refresh (swapping out ad fatigue).
*   **Friday**: deeply diving into search terms reports to add "Negative Keywords" (blocking irrelevant clicks).

## 20 Semantic FAQs: Performance Media

### Strategic Questions
**1. How much budget do we need?**
For B2B, we recommend starting with at least $3k-$5k/month to gather statistically significant data. For local B2C, $1k-$2k can work.

**2. Google Ads vs. Facebook Ads?**
Google captures demand (high intent). Facebook generates demand (awareness). Most mature strategies need both.

**3. What is a "good" ROAS?**
Commonly, 4:1 (400%) is the target. For scaling phases, 2:1 might be acceptable. For mature campaigns, we aim for 8:1+.

**4. How long until we see results?**
PPC is instant traffic. You will get clicks on Day 1. However, optimizing for *profitable* CPA typically takes 1-3 months of data learning.

**5. Why are our leads low quality?**
Usually due to broad targeting or weak landing page copy. We tighten query matching and add "qualifying questions" to forms to filter out tire-kickers.

### Technical Questions
**6. What is "Quality Score"?**
Google's rating (1-10) of your ad relevance. A higher score lowers your cost-per-click. We obsess over improving this.

**7. Do you use "Broad Match" keywords?**
Carefully. We prefer "Phrase" and "Exact" match for control, using Broad Match only for discovery in limited experiments.

**8. What is "Retargeting"?**
Showing ads to people who visited your site but didn't convert. It is typically the highest ROAS channel because the user already knows you.

**9. How do you handle click fraud?**
We use tools like ClickCease to automatically block IP addresses of bots and competitors trying to drain your budget.

**10. What is "Attribution Modeling"?**
Deciding which ad gets credit for the sale. We move beyond "Last Click" to "Data-Driven" or "Linear" models to understand the full path to purchase.

### B2B Questions
**11. Is LinkedIn Ads too expensive?**
CPCs are high ($10-$20), but lead quality is unmatched. One closed enterprise deal pays for the entire campaign.

**12. Can we target specific job titles?**
Yes. "CTOs at Finance companies with 500+ employees" is a standard targeting set on LinkedIn.

**13. What is a "Lead Magnet"?**
An asset (PDF, Calculator, Webinar) you offer in exchange for an email address. It is essential for B2B lead gen.

**14. Do you do "cold outreach"?**
PPC is "warm" outreach. We attract, we don't interrupt.

**15. How do we track offline sales?**
We use GCLID (Google Click ID) to pass data into your CRM. When you mark a deal "Won," it pings Google Ads.

### Creative Questions
**16. Do you design the ads?**
Yes. Our creative team produces the banners and writes the copy as part of the retainer.

**17. Do we need video?**
Yes. Video ads (especially on Meta/LinkedIn) consistently outperform static images for engagement.

**18. How often should we change ads?**
Every 2-4 weeks. "Ad Fatigue" sets in when users see the same creative too many times, causing costs to rise.

**19. Can we use stock photos?**
We avoid them. Authentic photos of your team/product perform 30-50% better.

**20. What is a "Hook"?**
The first 3 seconds of a video or the headline of an ad. If you don't hook them, the rest doesn't matter.
