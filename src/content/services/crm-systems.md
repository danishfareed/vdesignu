## Phase 1: Data Architecture

Garbage in, garbage out. We start by cleaning your data and defining strict governance rules.

### 1. Data Normalization
Standardizing formats for names, addresses, and industries to ensure segmentation is accurate.

### 2. Identity Resolution
Merging duplicate records to create a "Golden Record" for each customer.

## Phase 2: Process Automation

We automate the busywork so your team can focus on selling.

### 1. Lead Scoring Models
Building algorithms that rank leads based on behavior (website visits, email opens) and demographics.

### 2. Pipeline Triggers
Automatically moving deals through stages based on activity (e.g., "Contract Sent" -> "Negotiation").
