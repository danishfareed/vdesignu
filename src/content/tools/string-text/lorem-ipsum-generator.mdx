## What is Lorem Ipsum?
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. It has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

### Why do we use it?
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.

### Modern Web Design
In modern web development, "Lorem Ipsum" is essential for:
1. **Wireframing**: Filling layout containers to test responsiveness.
2. **Typography**: Checking font weights, line-heights, and paragraph spacing.
3. **Prototypes**: presenting visual concepts to clients without distraction.
