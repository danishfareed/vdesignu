## Why Use a Word Counter?
Writing for the web requires precision. Whether you are crafting a tweet (280 characters), a meta description (160 characters), or a blog post (1500+ words), knowing your exact text length is crucial.

### Key Features
- **Real-time Analysis**: No need to click a button; stats update as you type.
- **Reading Time**: Estimates how long it takes an average reader to consume your content.
- **Detailed Metrics**: Tracks paragraphs and sentences to help distinct between dense and readable copy.
- **Privacy Focused**: Your text is processed entirely in your browser. No data is sent to our servers.

### SEO Best Practices
For optimal SEO, we recommend blog posts be at least **300 words**, with **1,500-2,500 words** being the sweet spot for ranking on competitive keywords.
