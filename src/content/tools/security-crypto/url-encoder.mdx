## URL Encoding Explained
URLs can only contain a limited set of characters (ASCII alphanumeric). Special characters like spaces, question marks, and ampersands must be **encoded** so they don't break the URL structure.

- **Space** -> `%20`
- **/** -> `%2F`
- **?** -> `%3F`

This tool uses the JavaScript `encodeURIComponent` function for reliable standard compliance.
