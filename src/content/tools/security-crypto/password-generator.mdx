## Security Tips
- **Length Matters**: A 12-character password takes exponentially longer to crack than an 8-character one. Aim for at least 16 characters for critical accounts.
- **Mix it Up**: Always use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- **Client-Side**: Our generator runs locally in your browser. No data is ever sent to our servers.
