## About MD5
The **MD5 (Message-Digest Algorithm 5)** produces a 128-bit hash value.

### Is it Secure?
**No.** MD5 is cryptographically broken and vulnerable to collision attacks (where two different inputs produce the same hash).

### When to use it?
- **Checksums**: Verifying that a file hasn't been corrupted during download.
- **Non-critical IDs**: Generating unique identifiers where security isn't paramount.
- **Legacy Systems**: Interacting with older databases.
