## About SHA-256
**SHA-256** (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is a member of the SHA-2 family designed by the NSA. It is widely considered **secure**.

### Use Cases
- **Password Storage**: Often used with a "salt" to store user passwords.
- **Digital Signatures**: Verifying authenticity of documents.
- **Blockchain**: Bitcoin uses SHA-256 for proof-of-work.
