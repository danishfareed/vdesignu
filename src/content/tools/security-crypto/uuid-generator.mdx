## UUID vs GUID
They are essentially the same thing. **UUID** stands for Universally Unique Identifier, while **GUID** stands for Globally Unique Identifier (microsoft's terminology).

### Version 4
This tool generates **Version 4** UUIDs, which are purely random.
Format: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`
- The `4` indicates version 4.
- The `y` is one of `8`, `9`, `A`, or `B`.
