## What is Base64?
Base64 represents binary data in an ASCII string format by translating it into a radix-64 representation.

### Common Uses
- **Data URIs**: Embedding small images directly into CSS or HTML to reduce HTTP requests.
- **Email Attachments**: MIME uses Base64 to transmit non-text attachments.
- **APIs**: Sending binary data (like files) over JSON APIs.

### Security Warning
Base64 is **encoding**, not encryption. Someone with a decoder can easily read the original message. Do not use it to hide passwords or sensitive keys.
