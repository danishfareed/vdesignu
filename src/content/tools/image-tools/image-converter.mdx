## Intelligent Image Conversion
Need to change an image format? Our tool handles the most common conversions completely in your browser.

### Use Cases
- **Convert to WebP**: Reduce file size significantly for your website without quality loss.
- **Convert to JPG**: The most compatible format for emails, documents, and printing.
- **Convert to PNG**: Preserve transparency (alpha channel) for logos and graphics.

### Privacy First
Unlike other converters, we **never** upload your files to a server. The conversion happens locally on your device using your browser's processing power. This means your sensitive photos remain 100% private.
