## Why Compress Images?
Large images are the #1 reason for slow websites. Compressing your images is the easiest way to improve your PageSpeed score, SEO rankings, and user experience.

### How It Works
Our tool uses advanced browser-based compression algorithms to remove unnecessary metadata and optimize color profiles. 
- **No Server Uploads**: Your images never leave your device. Privacy is guaranteed.
- **Smart Compression**: We balance quality and file size to ensure your images look sharp while loading fast.
- **Bulk Processing**: Compress multiple files at once to save time.

### Supported Formats
- **JPG/JPEG**: Best for photographs and complex images.
- **PNG**: Best for transparent images and screenshots.
- **WebP**: The modern standard for web images, offering superior compression.
