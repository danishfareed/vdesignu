## Pixels vs. REM: Which should you use?

In modern web development, **REM (Root EM)** is generally preferred over pixels for font sizes, spacing, and layout elements.

### The Accessibility Argument
When you define sizes in pixels (e.g., `font-size: 16px`), you are hard-coding that value. If a user with visual impairments sets their browser's base font size to 24px, your website will ignore their preference and force 16px, making text hard to read.

Using REM (e.g., `font-size: 1rem`), your layout scales relatively. `1rem` equals "100% of the root font size". If the user wants bigger text, your entire site scales up proportionally.

### The Math
The formula is simple:
```math
REM = Pixels / Base Size
Pixels = REM * Base Size
```
Most browsers have a default base size of 16px.
- 16px = 1rem
- 24px = 1.5rem
- 32px = 2rem
