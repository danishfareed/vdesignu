## Why Dimensions Matter
Uploading the wrong image size causes social platforms to auto-crop or stretch your visual, often making it look blurry or unprofessional.

### Cheat Sheet 2026
We keep this guide updated with the latest changes from each major platform.

- **Instagram**: Focus on **4:5 Vertical** posts (1080x1350) instead of square, as they take up more screen real estate on mobile, increasing engagement.
- **YouTube**: Your **Thumbnail** (1280x720) is your first impression. High contrast and readable text are key.
- **LinkedIn**: Professionalism is ensuring your **Cover Photo** isn't pixelated on desktop monitors.

### Safe Zones
For platforms like YouTube Banners or responsive Twitter Headers, remember that the "safe zone" (centered area) is what is visible on all devices, especially mobile. Keep logos and text there.
