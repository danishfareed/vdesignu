## Create Beautiful Gradients
Gradients add depth and dimension to your web designs. Our generator makes it easy to experiment with complex color transitions without writing a single line of code manually.

### Tips for Better Gradients
- **Subtlety is Key**: The best gradients often use two colors that are close to each other on the color wheel.
- **Direction**: Use a slight angle (e.g., 135deg) rather than straight up/down for a more modern look.
- **Accessibility**: Verify that your white text is readable over the darkest part of your gradient.

### CSS Syntax Explained
The tool generates standard CSS3 syntax:
```css
background: linear-gradient(90deg, #ff00cc 0%, #333399 100%);
```
- **Angle**: The direction of the gradient line.
- **Stops**: The specific colors and their percentage positions along the line.
