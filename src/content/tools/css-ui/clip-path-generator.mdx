## Shaping the Web
Web design doesn't have to be just boxes and rectangles. The `clip-path` property allows you to mask elements into custom shapes such as circles, ellipses, and polygons.

### How it Works
The `clip-path` property defines a specific region of an element that should remain visible. Everything outside this region is "clipped" or hidden.

### Common Uses
1.  **Creative Headers**: Angled or curved dividers between screen sections.
2.  **Avatars**: Hexagonal or star-shaped profile pictures.
3.  **Interactive Galleries**: Revealing images on hover with animated clip-paths.
