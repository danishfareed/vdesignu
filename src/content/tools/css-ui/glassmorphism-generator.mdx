## The Frosted Glass Effect
Glassmorphism is a popular UI trend that creates a sense of hierarchy by mimicking translucent materials. It relies heavily on the `backdrop-filter` CSS property.

### Key Characteristics
1.  **Translucency**: Using background blur (`backdrop-filter: blur()`) to allow background elements to be visible but distinct.
2.  **Vivid Colors**: Often paired with colorful, floating shapes in the background to emphasize the transparency.
3.  **Light Borders**: A subtle semi-transparent white border mimics a glass edge.

### Browser Support
This effect works in all modern browsers. We include the `-webkit-` prefix in the generated code to ensure maximum compatibility with Safari and iOS devices.
