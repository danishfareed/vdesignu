## Mastering Shadows
Shadows are a critical element in modern web design, adding depth, hierarchy, and affordance to your interface.

### The Properties
- **Horizontal/Vertical Offset**: Moves the shadow relative to the element. Positive values move right/down, negative moves left/up.
- **Blur Radius**: Controls how sharp or soft the shadow edge is. Higher = softer.
- **Spread Radius**: Expands or shrinks the shadow size relative to the element size.
- **Color/Alpha**: The key to realistic shadows is transparency. Avoid pure black; use a dark shade of your background or brand color with low opacity (e.g., 10-20%).

### Design Trends
- **Soft Shadows**: Large blur + low opacity creates a modern, floating effect common in SaaS dashboards.
- **Neumorphism**: Uses two shadows (one light, one dark) to make elements appear extruded from the background.
